## 👋 Hey, I'm Gabriel  

I'm a mostly self-taught developer, currently studying **Computer Science @ [Transilvania University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transilvania_University_of_Bra%C8%99ov) in [Kronstadt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%C8%99ov)**.  
My programming style leans toward **object-oriented thinking**, both in code and project architecture.

I like to keep things **simple, modular, and efficient**, with a strong focus on **performance and scalability**.  
I don't rely on claude code or anything similar, being against this whole 'vibe-coding' phenomenon.  
I prefer learning the classic way: reading the docs → experimenting → refining through trial and error.

I’m currently contributing as a code maintainer at [tosuapp/tosu](https://github.com/tosuapp/tosu).
